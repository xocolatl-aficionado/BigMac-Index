# Valuing currencies using the Big Mac

## But why?
Currencies exchange at specific rates, which fluctuate all the time, leading to many a dazed worker who saw a part of their life savings evaporate into the ether upon contact with the famed wire transfer. So I thought it pertinent to be able to easily compare the price of the Big Mac&trade; across countries to quantify the bang for the respective buck. 

The [Big Mac index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac_Index) was invented by [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/big-mac-index) in 1986 as a lighthearted guide to whether currencies are at their “correct” level. 
 

But _why_ do these exchange rates rise and fall? Cant we set them and forget them? That [is](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency-peg.asp) an option, but has many hurdles still. 

And if they do fluctuate, on a regular Tuesday, when I land in Zurich after my long flight from Miami, can I at least buy a Big Mac&trade; in exchange for the same amount of sweat and blood that they ask for it back in Miami?

No. 

But.... _why_?
